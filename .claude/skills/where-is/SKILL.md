name: where-is
description: Locate where a concept lives in the Coremetry codebase — delegates the search to an Explore subagent and returns a short ranked list of file:line pointers with a one-line summary each, so the main session's context is never spent on grep+read cycles. Use when the operator asks "X kodu nerede" / "where is X handled" and the target is a fuzzy concept (the SLO burn-rate evaluator, the ingest pipeline drop rules, system_settings hydration) rather than a name you could grep in one shot. Do NOT use when the user already gave you the symbol or file name (just grep it), and do NOT use for "how does X work" explanations — this skill returns pointers only, never prose, never edits.

# /where-is — codebase concept lookup

Most of Coremetry's surfaces follow naming conventions
(chstore.GetX, copilotExplainX, FooPanel, /api/foo/{id}) but
"the SLO burn-rate evaluator" or "the ingest pipeline drop rules"
isn't a function name — it's a *concept* that takes 3-5 grep
iterations to track down. Each iteration reads files into the
main session's context window. By call 5 the agent is bloated
and slower.

This skill delegates the search to an `Explore` subagent that
returns ONLY file:line pointers + a one-line summary per hit.
Main session's context stays clean.

## When to use

- The user asks a "where is X" question.
- Investigating a bug + the entry point isn't obvious from
  the error message.
- Designing a `/spec` and the spec needs "like the existing
  Y" reference — find Y fast.

**Don't use** for:
- Symbols the user already named (just grep — one call).
- File paths the user already provided (just Read).
- "How does X work" deep-dives — that's a research session,
  not a lookup.

## Args

`/where-is <concept>` — natural language, 2-10 words.

Examples:
- `/where-is the SLO burn rate evaluator`
- `/where-is ingest pipeline drop rules`
- `/where-is the alert noisy-rule evaluator`
- `/where-is the topology aggregator goroutine`
- `/where-is the Drain templater`
- `/where-is system_settings hydration on boot`

## Steps

### 1. Dispatch the search to an Explore subagent

Use the Agent tool with `subagent_type: "Explore"`. The
prompt should be:

```
You are looking for: "<concept verbatim>"

Coremetry codebase. The "What goes WHERE" map in CLAUDE.md
covers the canonical paths; common search surfaces:

  Backend (Go):
    - internal/otlp/         OTLP ingest
    - internal/chstore/      CH writes + queries
    - internal/logstore/     ES/CH-agnostic log reads
    - internal/tempo/        external trace fallback
    - internal/api/          HTTP handlers + cache wrapper
    - internal/evaluator/    alert evaluator
    - internal/anomaly/      curated + recorder
    - internal/templater/    Drain
    - internal/notify/       notification fan-out
    - internal/auth/, internal/ldap/   auth
    - internal/copilot/      AI + system prompts
    - internal/pipeline/     ingest drop/enrich rules
    - internal/topology/     topology batch correlator
    - internal/chmigrate/    single-node → cluster data copy (no DDL)
    - migrations/ + internal/chstore/store.go migrate()   CH schema

  Frontend:
    - frontend/src/pages/        page roots
    - frontend/src/components/   panels + shared widgets
    - frontend/src/lib/types.ts  shared types
    - frontend/src/lib/api.ts    client methods
    - frontend/src/App.tsx       route registry
    - frontend/src/components/Sidebar.tsx  nav registry

  Skills:
    - .claude/skills/**.md   slash command definitions

For each hit:
  - file:line (markdown link form: [filename](path#L42))
  - one short sentence on what's there

Return the entry points a reader would open first, most
central first — usually a handful. If more files are
involved, list them compactly as bare file:line under a
"+N more" line. No preamble, no explanation of methodology.
The caller wants pointers, not narrative.

Search breadth: very thorough. The caller will burn time
on missing matches.
```

### 2. Format the response

The subagent returns a list of file:line + sentence pairs.
Pass them through unchanged — don't re-summarise (the
subagent already did). Add at the top:

```
Found N hit(s) for "<concept>":
```

If the subagent returns zero hits: try once more with a
broader phrasing (e.g. drop "the" / "logic" / "evaluator")
before reporting "no obvious match — concept may be
described differently in the code".

### 3. Don't load the files yourself

The skill is a lookup, not a deep-read. The operator (or
the next agent step) decides which hit to open. If the
operator asks "open #2" or "explain that one", THEN read
the file — but that's a different call.

## Anti-patterns

- **Don't write code in this call.** Find-and-fix is two
  steps. The /bugfix skill or a normal edit handles step 2.
- **Don't expand the search to "everything that touches
  X".** Stay focused on the concept the operator named.
  Broad "every file mentioning auth" surveys are
  /scale-audit territory.
- **Don't return file paths without line numbers.** A bare
  `internal/api/api.go` is useless at 8000+ lines — the
  point of the skill is the file:line pinpoint.
- **Don't bypass the subagent.** Inline grep + read works
  but burns main-session context. The whole reason the
  skill exists is that delegation. If you find yourself
  doing the lookup manually, you're using the wrong tool.
