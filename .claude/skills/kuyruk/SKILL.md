description: Render the operator's prioritised DEVELOPMENT queue — in-progress and pending items grouped bugs > scale > features > polish, a short pick-list with effort estimates, ending in the literal prompt "Hangisi?" so the operator picks rather than reading analysis. Use when the operator types "kuyruk" or asks what to work on next. Do NOT use for the P1/P2/P3 triage of live Problem rows on Inbox/Topology (incident priority is a different surface), and never invent queue items the operator did not raise.

# /kuyruk — prioritised work queue

`kuyruk` is the operator's standing pattern for "what's next" — see
`CLAUDE.md` "Workflow". Goal of this skill: present
the current state of work in a form that takes <5 seconds to
scan, followed by "Hangisi?" so the operator picks rather than
reading more analysis.

## Steps

### 1. Gather signal in parallel

Pull from three places:

- **Active todo list** — `in_progress` and `pending` items (TodoWrite
  state). These reflect the agent's current session focus.
- **Memory** — any project memories tagged "deferred", "parked",
  or "next sprint". Look for `[[name]]` references suggesting
  outstanding decisions.
- **Recent git log** — `git log --oneline -8` to anchor "what just
  shipped" so the queue feels continuous with the prior release.

If running in a session where TodoWrite is empty AND no parked
items in memory, ask the user to seed the queue rather than
making one up.

### 2. Categorise

Group items into 2-4 buckets, in this priority order:

1. **Bugs / regressions** (`bug-fix`, "Operator-reported", "broken
   in prod"). Per CLAUDE.md, these interrupt feature work and
   ship as `v0.10.X+1` immediately — never batched.
2. **Scale / perf** — anything violating the CLAUDE.md "Hard
   constraints" (eager pickers, unbounded tables, missing
   `document.hidden` guards, MV-bypass on hot reads, cache-key
   digests) or breaching a "Performance budget" p99. Findings
   from `/scale-audit` queue here.
3. **Features** — new functionality the operator explicitly asked
   for.
4. **Polish** — consistency sweeps, refactors, low-impact UX nits.

Drop "ideas I had once" — only items the user explicitly
mentioned or that came out of agent investigation. The queue is
operator-owned, not agent-imagined.

### 3. Estimate effort

Annotate each with a rough time estimate from this scale:
- `~10 dk` — single CSS tweak, single file edit
- `~30 dk` — single endpoint, single new component
- `~1 saat` — feature with backend + frontend + types
- `~2 saat` — refactor, multi-file change, new schema column
- `~yarım gün` — bigger refactor; flag this — usually wants
  splitting up via `/spec` first

Without a real estimate, omit rather than guess. Operator can ask
if they care.

### 4. Render

Numbered list, short enough to scan in a few seconds: every bug and
in-progress item, then the top of each remaining bucket; if items are
left out, end with one line giving the count per bucket. Format:

```
| # | İş | Tahmin | Kategori |
|---|----|--------|----------|
| 1 | OperationPicker scale fix | ~30 dk | scale |
| 2 | Status page email resend | ~30 dk | feature |
| ... |
```

OR for very short queues (≤3), inline numbered:

```
1. OperationPicker scale fix — ~30 dk
2. Status page email resend — ~30 dk
3. AI rate admin Settings tab — ~45 dk
```

End with: `Hangisi?` (literally — operator's expected affordance).

### 5. Don't over-explain

No introductory paragraph. No "here's the queue you've been
building". No closing recommendation. The queue itself + the
"Hangisi?" prompt is the whole response.

This is feedback-load behaviour from this user — long explanations
get cut. See [[feedback-terse-responses]] in memory.

## Anti-patterns

- **Don't add items the user didn't ask for.** Surfacing "you
  should add tests" or "consider refactoring X" when the user
  didn't bring it up is noise.
- **Don't re-list shipped items.** If v0.10.X just landed, that's
  not "queue" — it's history. Skip it.
- **Don't sort by alphabetical / file path.** Sort by impact:
  bugs > scale > features > polish.
- **Don't include items already in_progress as also pending.**
  An in-progress item gets its own line at the top labelled
  "(in progress)" — never duplicate.
- **Don't conflate work-queue priority with incident triage.**
  The P1/P2/P3 hierarchy in CLAUDE.md is for `Problem` rows on
  the Inbox/Topology — a different surface. Use the
  bugs/scale/features/polish buckets here.
