description: Pre-commit review of the CURRENT working-tree diff against Coremetry's CLAUDE.md — hard constraints, performance budgets, architectural invariants, the ship checklist. Catches debug residue, commented-out blocks, eager-picker / MV-bypass / cache-key / copilotExplain-wrapper drift. Run after the code is written and BEFORE /release on a non-trivial change. This skill outranks the generic code-review / simplify / security-review skills here, because only it knows this repo's own bug classes. Do NOT use for a whole-repo survey (use /scale-audit) or for a one-line change.

# /review-changes — second pair of eyes before /release

Coremetry ships fast (small commits, often 5+ per session).
The cost of that cadence is that minor code-quality regressions
slip through — debug `fmt.Println`, commented-out blocks left
"just in case", `<Combobox options={...}>` violations against
the picker convention, hot reads bypassing the `*_summary_5m`
MVs, new polling without a `document.hidden` guard, Copilot
endpoints bypassing `s.copilotExplain(r, …)`. This skill
catches them BEFORE the commit lands.

The yardstick is the architect-grade `CLAUDE.md` — its "Hard
constraints", "Architectural invariants", "Performance budgets",
and "Ship checklist" sections are the rubric.

## When to use

- After finishing a non-trivial feature commit (3+ files
  touched, or any new schema / API surface).
- Before `/release` on anything that's not a 1-line bug fix.
- When the operator asks "her şey iyi mi" / "is this ready
  to ship" — same intent.

**Don't use** for:
- One-line CSS tweaks (waste of skill cycles)
- Test-only changes (no production risk)
- Pure dependency bumps

## Steps

### 1. Pull the diff

```
git status --short
git diff --stat
git diff
```

If diff is empty: tell the operator there's nothing to review
and stop.

### 2. Scan for the standard issue classes

Run each check on the diff. For each finding, output
`file.ext:line — issue — one-line suggestion`. Stay terse.

**Class A — Debug residue (block ship if found)**
- `fmt.Println` / `fmt.Printf` (Go) — debug print left in
- `console.log` / `console.error` / `console.debug` (TS) — same
- `panic("debug")` / `panic("here")` style temporary panics
- Bare `time.Sleep(...)` in production paths (test-only is OK)
- Hard-coded localhost URLs / API keys / test credentials

**Class B — Commented-out blocks (block if >5 lines)**
- Multi-line comment blocks that look like commented-out code
  rather than docs. Single-line `//` explaining WHY is fine;
  10 lines of `// const x = ...` is not.

**Class C — Hard-constraint violations (CLAUDE.md "Hard constraints")**
- `<Combobox options={services|operations|metricNames}>` —
  must use `*Picker` (server-debounced search).
- New table over ~100 rows without virtualization /
  pagination / `content-visibility: auto`.
- New `fmt.Sprintf("...:exN=%d", len(set))` style cache key
  using length-of-set as a discriminator (v0.5.187 incident
  — use sorted+FNV digest instead).
- `timeRangeToNs(range)` invoked inside JSX / IIFE / unmemoised
  hook body — burns `useEffect` deps on every render (v0.5.184).
  Must live inside `useMemo([range])` or `useEffect` body.
- ClickHouse query on `spans` / `metric_points` lacking `LIMIT`,
  `SETTINGS max_execution_time`, or a time-bounded WHERE on an
  indexed column.

**Class D — Architectural-invariant drift (CLAUDE.md "Architectural invariants")**
- Hot read aggregating raw `spans` when a matching MV exists
  (`service_summary_5m`, `operation_summary_5m`,
  `topology_edges_5m`, `db_summary_5m`, `db_caller_summary_5m`,
  `topology_root_flows_5m`). Reading raw spans at billion-row
  scale is a bug, not a perf nit.
- New state table not using `ReplacingMergeTree(version)` +
  `FINAL` on read — version-less state has dedup glare.
- New per-surface schema for user-saved state. `saved_views`
  with `page='<kind>'` is the catch-all.
- New config struct without `LoadPersisted(ctx, store)` at boot
  + `SavePersisted(...)` on admin PUT. `system_settings` is the
  one table for operator config (see `internal/tempo/client.go`
  template).
- Copilot handler calling `s.copilot.Explain(r.Context(), …)`
  directly — must go through `s.copilotExplain(r, …)` so the
  `ai_calls` row lands and `/ai` attribution stays accurate.
- Log detector / pattern query reaching into `chstore` direct
  instead of `logstore.Store` (CountPatterns batched form,
  `_msearch` on ES, tokenbf_v1 on CH).

**Class E — Performance-budget drift (CLAUDE.md "Performance budgets")**
- Polling interval shorter than 10s on anything except
  `/api/health` (5s) — usually means the surface should be
  SSE / WebSocket instead of poll.
- New `setInterval` / `refetchInterval` without a
  `document.hidden` pause guard (v0.5.248). The pattern is:
  ```js
  setInterval(() => { if (!document.hidden) fetchOnce(); }, 30_000);
  ```
- New endpoint that fans out N CH queries in a loop instead of
  one batched roundtrip (especially against `spans`).
- New ES `significant_text` aggregation without
  `background_filter` + `sampler` wrapper (v0.5.243).
- ES `query_string` with `case_insensitive: true` — rejected
  by ES 8.x as unknown field (v0.5.231). Don't add it back.

**Class F — Authz / audit hygiene**
- New admin mutation route without an `s.audit(r, ...)` call.
- New endpoint without `auth.RequireRole` / `RequireAnyRole`
  when it should have one (mutating? admin-only? gated).
- Viewer-blank surface — viewer should SEE state (read-only
  chip), not get a 403 / blank panel.

**Class G — Naming / structure drift**
- Functions/types named ad-hoc rather than following the
  neighbouring file's convention (Get/List/Compute/Upsert
  in chstore, copilotXxx for AI handlers, *Picker for
  pickers).
- Unused exports, unused imports (the compiler catches some,
  but unused fields and types slip).
- New top-level state in a component where useState would do.
- Re-declared type in a component when `lib/types.ts` already
  has it (or should).

**Class H — Comment hygiene**
- Multi-line block comments that explain WHAT the code does
  rather than WHY (CLAUDE.md's defaults: don't comment WHAT,
  only WHY and only when non-obvious).
- New comments referencing "current bug" / "current task" /
  "issue #X" — those belong in the commit message, not the
  code (they rot fast).
- Missing comment on a counter-intuitive line (e.g. why a
  cache key includes a length, why a fetch is debounced at
  exactly 200ms — non-obvious choices should have a one-
  liner).

**Class I — Risk on dangerous paths**
- Goroutines launched without timeout / cancellation —
  fire-and-forget leaks. Should use bounded context.
- `for { ... }` without a clear exit condition.
- Cache TTL of 0 / unbounded cache without LRU.
- New panic on a user-driven path. Errors should be
  returned, not paniced.
- New `LowCardinality(String)` skipped on a high-cardinality
  dimension (or `String` used on what should be `LowCardinality`).

### 3. Produce the report

Use this format:

```
## Diff review — N files, +X / -Y lines

### 🚫 Blockers (fix before /release)
- file.go:42 — fmt.Println debug residue — remove
- file.tsx:88 — Combobox options=services — swap to ServicePicker
- file.go:120 — s.copilot.Explain direct call — wrap via s.copilotExplain

### ⚠️ Should fix (recommend)
- file.go:123 — comment explains WHAT (lines 124-130 already say it). Drop.
- file.tsx:200 — new inline color #ff5252 — use var(--err) per CLAUDE.md.
- file.go:88 — aggregates `FROM spans` — use service_summary_5m.

### 💡 Optional polish
- ...

### ✅ Clean
- conventions / naming / typing all in line
- audit + auth gates present on admin paths
- polling components pause on document.hidden
```

If there are no findings: report "clean" with one line on the
biggest pattern noticed (e.g. "follows the existing SLOs +
Slos.tsx pattern; OK to ship").

### 4. Don't fix anything yourself in this call

This skill REPORTS. The operator either fixes the issues then
re-runs the review, or invokes `/release` to ship as-is for
the non-blocker items. Mixing review + fix in the same call
loses the audit trail of "what was flagged".

## Anti-patterns

- **Don't lecture.** "You should always X" comments are noise.
  Cite the file:line and suggest the fix; the WHY lives in
  CLAUDE.md.
- **Don't flag pre-existing style the diff merely touches.**
  Only what this diff adds counts — and a NEW fully static
  inline style block, raw hex, or raw `<button>` is a finding
  even in a file full of them (/frontend-design-system §9).
- **Don't fabricate issues.** If the diff is genuinely clean,
  say so. False positives erode trust in future runs.
- **Don't expand to architecture review.** "You should
  refactor X to Y" is `/scale-audit` territory, not
  per-commit review.
- **Don't surface CLAUDE.md violations that were ALREADY
  in the file before this diff.** Only flag what THIS diff
  introduces / touches.
