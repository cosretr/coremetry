description: Cut a Coremetry release — compute the next v0.10.X tag from git tags, run every gate, stage explicit paths, commit in the CLAUDE.md format, annotate the tag, push, then rebuild the image in the background with `make image` (never `make docker-up` — v0.9.210). Use when the operator explicitly asks to release / ship / tag the current change. All gates CI runs block the tag — frontend `npx tsc --noEmit && npx eslint src && TZ=UTC npx vitest run`, `go build ./... && go vet ./...`, `go test ./...`, and `make audit` (🔴 critical stops the tag, 🟡 goes to the operator). On a non-trivial diff run /review-changes first. Do NOT use for a bare "commit this" with no tag, and never fold unrelated changes into one release.

# /release — ship a Coremetry change

Use this skill to turn the current working-tree state into a shipped
Coremetry release. Follows the conventions in `CLAUDE.md` —
small frequent commits, monotonic v0.10.X tags, push, background
rebuild.

## Args

The user invokes as `/release [short title]`. The argument (if any)
becomes the **title** of the commit and tag. If omitted, ask the user
for one — never invent a title from `git diff` alone, the commit
title should reflect intent, not a description of the diff.

## Steps

### 1. Verify there's something to release

Run in parallel:
```
git status --short
git diff --stat
```

If both are empty: tell the user there's nothing to commit and stop.

If there are untracked files that look like junk (build artifacts,
.DS_Store, editor swap files), warn but don't auto-clean — the
operator may want them.

### 2. Determine the next version

```
git tag --sort=-v:refname | grep -E '^v0\.10\.[0-9]+$' | head -1
```

Increment the patch component by 1. Example: previous tag `v0.10.932`
→ next is `v0.10.933`. The series is monotonic; never re-use a tag —
and a gap (a skipped number) is fine, re-using one is not.

### 3. Type-check, lint, unit tests, build — the gate

The same chain CI runs (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`, CONTRIBUTING.md §3;
CLAUDE.md "Ship checklist" steps 9 + 10). Run in parallel based on which
file types changed:
- Any `frontend/**` change:
  `cd frontend && npx tsc --noEmit && npx eslint src && TZ=UTC npx vitest run`
  (vitest carries the ratchets — `buttonUnityRatchet`, `tableUnityRatchet` —
  a red one otherwise surfaces only in CI after the tag is pushed)
- Any `*.go` change: `go build ./... && go vet ./...`

If either fails, surface the error and stop — don't try to fix it
silently. The operator decides whether to fix-forward or abort.

### 3a. `go test ./...` — regression suite gate (v0.5.447)

Run after the build gate. The regression-test discipline
(CLAUDE.md "Ship checklist" item 11) ships a test per
`v0.10.X — bug-fix` release, so the suite grows over time and
catches recurrence of historical bug classes.

- Exit non-zero: STOP. Surface the failing test name to the
  operator. Don't tag — a red test on a release branch is the
  signal the user asked us to install.
- Skip safely on tags that don't touch Go (`docs/` only,
  `frontend/` only) — but err on the side of running.

### 3b. `make audit` — hard-constraint linter (v0.5.446)

Run `make audit` after the type-check/build gate but before
staging. It greps for the regression patterns from CLAUDE.md's
"Hard constraints" and "Pitfall rules" sections (cache-key
length anti-pattern, eager Combobox, setInterval without
document.hidden, direct s.copilot.Explain, non-GLOBAL IN over
Distributed, FROM spans without nearby LIMIT).

- Exit 1 (🔴 critical findings present): STOP. Surface findings,
  let the operator decide fix-forward or abort. Don't tag.
- Exit 0 with warnings (🟡 only): print the warning list, ask
  the operator if any are unexpected. If all are known false
  positives (e.g. Profiling.tsx pprof code-sample template),
  proceed.

### 4. Stage the changes

Use `git add` with **specific paths** (never `-A` / `.`) to avoid
accidentally staging secrets, .env files, large binaries, or
unrelated working-tree noise. List the staged files back to the
user via `git diff --cached --stat`.

### 5. Compose the commit message

Format per CLAUDE.md exactly, using a HEREDOC so newlines preserve:

```
v0.10.X — <short title, max 70 chars>

<body — what changed and why; wrap at 72 chars. If this is a
bug fix, start the body with "Operator-reported: <one-line
description of the original report>". Include the root cause
when it's non-obvious. Keep the body tight — 3-12 lines is
typical for v0.10.X commits.>

Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>
```

The body should be derived from the actual diff content + the
conversation context (what motivated the change). Don't pad it.

### 6. Commit, tag, push

Run these sequentially (each depends on the last):

```
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
... message from step 5 ...
EOF
)"
git tag -a v0.10.X -m "v0.10.X — <short title>"
git push origin main
git push origin v0.10.X
```

Tag annotation message can be just the title — the full body lives
on the commit.

### 7. Kick off the rebuild

Start `make image` in the **background** so the user can keep
working while the image rebuilds:

```
make image
```

**Use `make image`, NOT `make docker-up`** (v0.9.210). `docker-up`
also starts the compose stack, which stands a second Coremetry up
on :8088 next to the minikube one on :8090 — two full environments
with two ClickHouses. The local environment is minikube; the
release flow only needs the image built and tagged. Reach for
`make docker-up` only when the compose stack itself is the goal.

Use `run_in_background: true` on the Bash call. The runtime will
notify when it completes (~30-60s). Do NOT wait inline — that
blocks the conversation.

If a previous `make image` is still running (the user can see
this in `docker ps` if needed), tell them rather than starting a
second one — the rebuild lock will fight itself and produce a
broken image. CLAUDE.md is explicit: one rebuild at a time.

### 8. Confirm

One concise line: which version was tagged, which commit hash, and
that rebuild is running. No multi-paragraph summary — the diff is
visible in the commit, the operator knows what they shipped.

Example confirmation:
> v0.10.933 commit/push tamam, rebuild arkada. <release title>

## Common pitfalls

- **Don't amend.** If a pre-commit hook fails, fix the underlying
  issue and create a NEW commit (the failed one didn't exist).
  Amending past tags risks losing the previous push.
- **Don't push --force.** Ever. Even on a tag.
- **Don't skip the type-check / build.** A red build that ships
  breaks the rebuild cycle and the operator has to revert.
- **Don't re-use a tag.** If `v0.10.X` exists, the next is X+1, even
  if X was a no-op or got reverted.
- **Don't combine unrelated changes.** If the working tree has two
  logical units of work, do two separate releases — the small
  commit cadence is the workflow.
- **Bug fix commits go IMMEDIATELY.** Don't batch a bug fix into a
  feature commit — ship the bug fix as its own v0.10.X+1 right after
  the prior release.
- **Don't `make image` while another rebuild is in flight.**
  BuildKit serialises layer cache; concurrent rebuilds fight and
  one of the resulting images will be broken.
