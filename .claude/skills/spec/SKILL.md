description: Turn a vague Coremetry feature request into a one-page implementation spec the operator approves BEFORE any code is written — files to touch in CLAUDE.md order, API surface, CH schema/migration, cache-key + auth + audit gates, UX surface, risk, effort estimate. Use when the operator describes WHAT they want in a sentence or two AND the obvious implementation spans 3+ files (new endpoint, new admin surface, new CH column, new AI explain surface); after approval, backend work continues under /tdd and ships via /release. Do NOT use for single-file edits, CSS/copy tweaks, a bug whose root cause is already known (use /bugfix), or open-ended discussion with no intent to build.

# /spec — idea → implementation plan, then ship

The default Coremetry workflow is small commits + frequent
releases. The biggest cost in that workflow is starting on the
wrong implementation — picking the wrong file structure, the
wrong API shape, the wrong UX surface, and burning 30 min
before pivoting. This skill removes that cost by surfacing a
1-minute spec for explicit approval BEFORE the edit phase.

The spec's "Files" section follows the 11-step "Ship checklist"
in CLAUDE.md — backend → cache → auth →
audit → settings → frontend type → frontend client → frontend
component → ts gate → go gate. That ordering is the path that's
proven not to need rework.

## When to use

- The user describes a feature in 1-2 sentences and the
  obvious implementation has 3+ files involved.
- The user says "let's add X" and X looks like a new admin
  surface, a new endpoint, a new schema column, or a new
  AI surface.
- The work is large enough that a wrong start costs >15 min
  of rework.

**Don't use** for:
- One-line CSS tweaks
- Bug fixes where the root cause is already named
- Single-file edits to existing code

For those, just do them.

## Args

`/spec <one-line description>` — the user's intent verbatim.

## Output shape

Produce a markdown spec with these sections, in this order:

```
## What
1-3 sentences restating the user's intent in concrete terms.
Catches misunderstanding early.

## Files (in shipping order)
Backend, top-down (per CLAUDE.md's Ship checklist):
- internal/chstore/foo.go (+N lines) — new MV query method
- internal/api/<domain>.go (new file) — register*Routes + init() registerRoutesExtra, handler, serveCached, audit, auth gate (/api-route)
Then frontend, top-down:
- frontend/src/lib/types.ts (+N lines) — new shared type
- frontend/src/lib/api.ts (+N lines) — client method
- frontend/src/components/FooPanel.tsx (new file, ~X lines)
- frontend/src/pages/Foo.tsx (+N lines) — wire the panel + loading/empty states
Gates (these stay implicit in the workflow, no need to list):
- cd frontend && npx tsc --noEmit
- go build ./...

## API surface
- `GET/POST/PUT /api/<path>` — body shape (1 line)
- Auth gate: admin / editor / viewer / public
- Cache wrapper: serveCached key inputs (call out the digest if
  any input is a set)
- Audit row: kind.action if it mutates state

## Schema changes
- CH table additions / ALTERs (and the migration file)
- system_settings keys + the LoadPersisted/SavePersisted owner
- Or "none" if read-only.
Reminder: per-user state goes in `saved_views` with
`page='<kind>'`, not a new table.

## UX surface
- Where it shows up (which page, which panel, what affordance)
- One-line interaction sketch ("operator clicks foo → modal opens → enters bar → submit")
- Loading / empty / error states — name the component used
  (shared `<Spinner/>` and `<Empty/>`)
- Permission visibility: viewer SEES the state (chip), not blank

## Risk
Low / Medium / High + one sentence on the dominant risk.
Reference performance budgets if relevant: p99 target, polling
cadence, whether the read needs an MV.

## Estimate
~10 dk | ~30 dk | ~1 saat | ~2 saat | ~yarım gün
Use one of these brackets; finer estimates are noise.

## Open questions
Bullet list of decisions the operator should make BEFORE coding.
Empty if everything's obvious.
```

## Steps

1. **Re-state the intent in your own words.** If you can't,
   you don't have enough to spec — ask the operator for
   clarification first.

2. **Sniff the codebase.** Read the most-similar existing
   feature to anchor the spec on real conventions. The
   "Files" section should reference patterns that already
   work in this repo.
   - "Like the AI tab in pages/settings/AiTab.tsx"
   - "Like the OperationPicker pattern"
   - "Like the saved_views table with page='X'"
   - "Like the Tempo `LoadPersisted` template"
   When in doubt, dispatch an `Explore` subagent for the
   pattern search rather than burning main-session context.

3. **Identify open questions.** Common ones:
   - Auth gate: admin vs editor vs viewer
   - Storage: existing table vs new (default existing)
   - Visibility: per-user vs team-shared
   - Empty / error UX: spinner vs blank vs CTA
   - Read source: MV vs raw spans (default MV when one exists)
   - Cache TTL + key digest for any set-shaped input
   List them. The operator decides up front rather than at
   minute 25 when the question becomes a pivot.

4. **Present the spec + WAIT FOR APPROVAL.**
   - End with a one-line "Spec'i onaylıyor musun? Açık soru
     varsa o ilkönce."
   - Do NOT start editing.

5. **After approval, switch to implementation mode.**
   - Use `/release` to ship at the end.
   - If during implementation the spec needs to change (a
     file count was off, an unforeseen dep surfaced), tell
     the operator — don't silently expand scope.

## Anti-patterns

- **Don't over-spec.** A spec should fit in a chat message.
  Two pages of design doc is wrong format — that's a design doc,
  not a /spec.
- **Don't include the IMPLEMENTATION of the code in the
  spec.** The spec is the WHAT and WHERE; code samples
  belong in the actual edit.
- **Don't invent files that don't exist.** "Add to
  ServiceDeployPanel.tsx" only works if that file exists.
  Either reference real files OR mark them "(new file)".
- **Don't skip the open-questions section.** Even one open
  question saved is worth the line. The empty list is
  rare; if it's empty, mention that.
- **Don't drift into the next feature.** Stay focused on
  the user's single ask. If they want "X and also Y",
  spec X and mention "Y as follow-up".
- **Don't propose a new schema for user-saved state.** The
  default is `saved_views`. If the spec says "new table",
  defend why before the operator wastes time on a migration.
