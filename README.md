## What it is

Coremetry collects every signal the OpenTelemetry ecosystem
produces and turns them into the dashboards an SRE actually
opens during an incident. Native OTLP ingest (gRPC + HTTP) on
the same wire format Datadog, Honeycomb, Dynatrace, Grafana
Cloud agents already speak — drop the Coremetry endpoint into
your existing OTel collector or SDK and you're shipping data.
No proprietary SDK, no vendor agent, no shim layer.

---

## How Coremetry compares

The closest open-source neighbours are SigNoz, Uptrace and HyperDX,
which also build on ClickHouse, and the Grafana stack (Tempo, Loki,
Mimir, Grafana). Commercial APMs (Datadog, Dynatrace, New Relic,
Honeycomb) are the usual incumbents. Rather than a feature matrix
that goes stale, here is what Coremetry deliberately chooses:

| Choice | What Coremetry does |
|---|---|
| **Moving parts** | One Go binary with the UI embedded, ClickHouse as the only store, Redis optional. One Helm chart, one image tag per release. No separate query, ingest, UI or rules services to version together. |
| **Ingest** | OTLP only (gRPC + HTTP). No proprietary agent, no vendor SDK, no second wire protocol. Whatever the OTel collector or SDK already emits is the input. |
| **Day-one SRE workflow** | Golden Signals / RED / USE and an Incident War Room are pre-seeded. Alerts are auto-grouped into incidents by a topological correlator; SLOs carry error-budget burn rate; runbooks can execute automated steps. These are built in, not dashboards you assemble. |
| **Enterprise access** | OIDC, LDAP / Active Directory with group-to-role mapping, RBAC and an append-only audit log ship in the open-source build, because that is the bar for running inside a regulated organisation. |
| **Existing log pipelines** | Logs always land in ClickHouse, but the read path can be pointed at an existing Elasticsearch cluster so teams keep their current log tooling while adopting traces and metrics. |
| **Platforms** | Helm for Kubernetes, flat manifests for OpenShift (restricted-v2 SCC), docker-compose for evaluation. |
| **LLM access** | A built-in MCP server exposes services, problems, traces, logs and metrics to Claude Desktop or any MCP client, with the same RBAC as the UI. |
| **Scale shape** | Same image runs monolithic for small installs or as ingest / api / worker deployments for billion-span/day. Switching is a Helm values change and a rolling upgrade. |

Where another tool may be the better fit: the Grafana ecosystem
offers a far larger catalogue of community dashboards, data sources
and plugins; commercial vendors offer managed hosting, APM agents
for languages without good OTel coverage, and support contracts;
and projects with longer histories have more battle-tested
migration tooling. Coremetry is pre-1.0 and says so in
[Status](#status).

---

## Features

### Signal coverage

- **Distributed tracing** — full waterfall view, critical-path
  highlighting, side-by-side trace compare with per-operation
  delta diff, Tempo-compatible `/api/traces` for Grafana.
- **Metrics** — OTLP metrics ingestion, span-derived RED
  metrics (rate / errors / duration aggregated per service +
  operation), built-in dashboards.
- **Logs** — native OTLP logs with token-bloom-filter search
  on the body, optional external Elasticsearch read backend
  for organisations whose pipeline already terminates there.
- **Profiles** — pprof / pyroscope-compatible ingestion +
  flamegraph viewer.
- **Frontend RUM** — built-in browser SDK dogfooding so the UI
  ships its own page-load + click + fetch traces back through
  OTLP. Use the pattern as a template for instrumenting your
  own apps.

### SRE workflow

- **SRE-perspective dashboards** out of the box — Golden
  Signals (Google), RED (Tom Wilkie), USE (Brendan Gregg) +
  Incident War Room, Latency Investigation, Error Hunting,
  Database Performance, External Dependencies, Infrastructure
  Saturation. Inspired by Datadog / Honeycomb / Dynatrace
  patterns.
- **Custom dashboards** — drag-droppable panels, Grafana-style
  template variables (`$service`, `$env` …). Versioned preset
  bundle migration so upgrades update the seed dashboards
  without clobbering user-built ones.
- **Service map** — force-directed topology graph derived from
  sampled trace edges; node colour = error rate, edge weight =
  call frequency. Click-through to per-service detail.
- **Alert rules + incidents** — configurable rules over RED
  metrics, auto-grouped into incidents using the built-in
  topological correlator (a payment-service timeout + an
  upstream api-gateway saturation alert end up in one incident
  the oncall drives end-to-end).
- **Anomaly detection** — log-pattern anomalies (curated
  regex fingerprints for Oracle errors, OOM, NPE, deadlocks,
  panics, etc.) + trace-op anomalies (per-endpoint error-rate
  spikes) + metric anomalies (z-score baseline). Snooze /
  silence with TTL.
- **SLOs** — availability + latency targets with error-budget
  burn rate computation.
- **Synthetic monitors** — HTTP probes + heartbeat ping URLs;
  state changes flow through the same notifier path as alert
  rules.

### Performance + scale

- **ClickHouse-first** — every read path is a CH query;
  no in-app indexing or rollup engine. Designed for billion-
  span/day with proper schema (LowCardinality columns,
  primary-key prefix, `tokenbf_v1` skip indexes on log body,
  bloom-filter on trace_id, MergeTree partitioning by day).
- **Distributed CH support** — the schema migrator emits
  `ON CLUSTER` DDL when `cluster_name` is set, creating
  `Replicated*MergeTree` tables on each shard plus a
  `Distributed` wrapper that fans out queries.
- **Async insert + parallel flushers** — 8-worker pool, 500k
  buffer, 5 s flush window (v0.10.240; was 2 s). Consumer pushback via bounded
  channels.
- **Trace sampling** — head sampling with always-keep-errors
  + always-keep-roots + per-service ratios. Optional buffered
  tail sampling that decides keep/drop based on aggregate
  trace properties (error / slow / probabilistic).
- **uPlot frontend charts** — replaces Chart.js for ~10× the
  render speed, ~100 KB smaller bundle.
- **Live updates via SSE** — problem.open / problem.resolve /
  anomaly.* events push to the browser; React Query
  invalidates the matching cache. Sub-second alert-to-UI
  latency vs the typical 30-s polling lag.

### Enterprise

- **OIDC SSO** — Google, Microsoft, Okta, generic OIDC.
  Central-login permission service (`POST /api/auth/permissions`):
  [docs/SSO-PERMISSION-SERVICE.md](docs/SSO-PERMISSION-SERVICE.md).
- **LDAP / Active Directory** — AD group → role mapping,
  recursive memberOf lookup, LDAPS + StartTLS, internal-CA
  paste-in.
- **RBAC** — admin / editor / viewer roles. Editor manages
  dashboards / monitors / alerts / incidents; admin owns
  user + system settings.
- **Audit log** — append-only, partitioned monthly, 365-day
  TTL. Filterable by actor / action / target.
- **Notification channels** — Slack, Microsoft Teams, generic
  webhook, email (SMTP), WhatsApp (Twilio). Per-channel min
  severity filter; channel CRUD + send-test from the UI.
- **AI Copilot** — explain-this-trace / explain-this-anomaly
  via Anthropic Claude or GitHub Copilot; key configured at
  runtime, hidden from the UI after save.
- **SQL playground** — admin-only direct ClickHouse query
  console with three-layer defence (role gate, app-level
  allow-list, CH `readonly=2` + 60-s exec cap).
- **Resource sampling settings UI** — adjust head + tail
  sampling ratios live without process restart.

## Quick start (docker-compose, evaluation)

Boots ClickHouse, Redis, OTel Collector, Coremetry plus a
Java + Go demo emitting realistic traffic.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cosretr/coremetry
cd coremetry
docker compose up -d
```

Web UI: `http://localhost:8088` — login with
`admin@coremetry.local` / `admin`. The demo apps populate
data within ~30 seconds; the SRE dashboards are pre-seeded.
OTLP endpoints for your own apps:

- gRPC: `localhost:4317`
- HTTP: `localhost:8088/v1/{traces,logs,metrics}`

---

## Production install (Helm)

The chart in `charts/coremetry` is the supported install
path. Bundles ClickHouse + Redis + the Coremetry app plus an
OTel Collector for ingest. External ClickHouse / Redis is
fully supported — point the chart values at them and disable
the bundled subcharts.

### Add the chart repository

The chart ships as an OCI artifact. From a Helm 3.8+ install:

```bash
helm install coremetry oci://ghcr.io/cosretr/charts/coremetry \
  --version <release-tag> \
  --create-namespace --namespace coremetry
```

Replace `<release-tag>` with a published release (see
[Releases](https://github.com/cosretr/coremetry/releases)) or
omit `--version` to take latest.

### Or install from a checkout

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cosretr/coremetry
cd coremetry
helm install coremetry charts/coremetry \
  --create-namespace --namespace coremetry \
  --set ingress.enabled=true \
  --set 'ingress.hosts[0].host=coremetry.example.com' \
  --set 'ingress.hosts[0].paths[0].path=/' \
  --set 'ingress.hosts[0].paths[0].pathType=Prefix' \
  --set secrets.jwtSecret="$(openssl rand -hex 32)"
```

### Pointing at an external ClickHouse cluster

```bash
helm install coremetry charts/coremetry \
  --set clickhouse.enabled=false \
  --set clickhouse.external.addr="ch1:9000,ch2:9000,ch3:9000,ch4:9000" \
  --set clickhouse.database="coremetry_prod" \
  --set clickhouse.username="coremetry" \
  --set secrets.clickHousePassword="<password>"
```

The driver round-robins / fails over across the seed list —
no upstream LB needed.

### Connect external apps

Inside the cluster the OTLP receiver lives at
`coremetry-otelcol:4317` (gRPC) or
`coremetry:8088/v1/{traces,logs,metrics}` (HTTP). Point your
apps' `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` at it.

### Reset schema on a fresh deploy

For first-install convenience the chart can drop + recreate
the entire CH database before the app pod starts:

```bash
helm install coremetry charts/coremetry \
  --set clickhouse.resetSchema=true
```

The pre-install hook Job runs `coremetry --reset-schema`,
which `DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS` + lets the app's normal
startup migrations rebuild the schema. **Destructive** — only
use on first install. Flip back to `false` for upgrades.

### OpenShift

A flat manifest set lives in `examples/openshift/` for
clusters that don't run Helm. Restricted-v2 SCC compatible
(no `runAsUser` pin), TLS-edge `Route` for the Web UI.

### Deployment topology — monolithic vs distributed (v0.6+)

The same Coremetry image runs in two shapes, picked via a
single values key. Switch at any time with a rolling upgrade:

```yaml
# values.yaml
deployment:
  mode: monolithic     # default — one Deployment, COREMETRY_MODE unset
  # OR
  mode: distributed    # three Deployments: ingest + api + worker
  roles:
    ingest: { replicas: 5 }   # scale up for OTLP fan-in load
    api:    { replicas: 2 }   # scale up for read HA / RPS
    worker: { replicas: 1 }   # MUST be 1 — leader-elected jobs
```

| Topology | When to use |
|---|---|
| `monolithic` (default) | POC, SME installs, dev clusters. One pod, one container, every subsystem in-process. Matches every Coremetry release up to v0.5.x — no migration cost for existing users. |
| `distributed` | Production at billion-spans/day scale. Three Deployments running the same image with `COREMETRY_MODE=ingest|api|worker`. Ingest scales horizontally for OTLP load; api scales for read HA; worker stays singleton (alert evaluator, anomaly detector, topology aggregator are leader-elected via Redis lock and a single replica avoids the lock-contention overhead). |

### Distributed install — one command, all components

A single `helm install` brings up the **entire** distributed stack —
the four Coremetry roles plus the bundled ClickHouse, Redis, and OTel
Collector. No external dependency is required: logs default to the
ClickHouse read backend, so Elasticsearch is optional (see below).

```bash
helm install coremetry oci://ghcr.io/cosretr/charts/coremetry \
  --version 0.7.109 \
  --namespace coremetry --create-namespace \
  --set deployment.mode=distributed \
  --set deployment.roles.ingest.replicas=3 \
  --set deployment.roles.api.replicas=2 \
  --set deployment.roles.worker.replicas=1 \
  --set deployment.roles.agent.enabled=true \
  --set secrets.jwtSecret="$(openssl rand -hex 32)" \
  --set secrets.initialAdminPassword="<choose-a-password>"
```

That one command renders, in namespace `coremetry`:

| Workload | Kind | Role (`COREMETRY_MODE`) |
|---|---|---|
| `coremetry-ingest` | Deployment ×3 | OTLP receivers + CH writers (`ingest`) |
| `coremetry-api` | Deployment ×2 | Web UI + REST API + SSE + MCP (`api`) |
| `coremetry-worker` | Deployment ×1 | evaluator + anomaly + topology agg + notifier — leader-elected, **keep at 1** (`worker`) |
| `coremetry-agent` | Deployment ×1 | runbook automated-step executor (http/js/bash), Redis-locked |
| `coremetry-clickhouse` | StatefulSet ×1 | bundled warm store (20Gi PVC) |
| `coremetry-redis` | Deployment ×1 | cache + leader lock + cross-pod SSE bridge |
| `coremetry-otelcol` | Deployment ×1 | OTLP collector → forwards to `coremetry-ingest:4317` |

Fronted by seven Services: the stable **`coremetry`** (aliases the api
role — point your Ingress/Route here), plus `coremetry-ingest`,
`coremetry-api`, `coremetry-worker`, and the `coremetry-clickhouse` /
`coremetry-redis` / `coremetry-otelcol` backends. With
`autoscaling.enabled=true` the HPA targets the api role.

> **Version pinning.** The chart's `appVersion` sets the default image
> tag, and published image tags are **un-prefixed** (`0.7.109`, *not*
> `v0.7.109`). To deploy a different build add `--set image.tag=<version>`.

**Production: external ClickHouse + Redis.** At billion-span scale,
disable the bundled single-node backends and point at your own cluster:

```bash
  --set clickhouse.enabled=false \
  --set clickhouse.external.addr="ch1:9000,ch2:9000,ch3:9000" \
  --set secrets.clickHousePassword="<password>" \
  --set redis.enabled=false \
  --set redis.external.url="redis://redis.internal:6379/0"
```

**Optional: Elasticsearch logs backend.** Coremetry always *writes*
logs to ClickHouse; this switches only the *read* path to an existing
ES pipeline. ES is **not bundled** — point at your cluster:

```bash
  --set logs.backend=elasticsearch \
  --set 'logs.elasticsearch.addresses={https://es.internal:9200}' \
  --set logs.elasticsearch.index="coremetry-logs" \
  --set secrets.esApiKey="<base64 id:api_key>"
```

Distributed mode requires Redis (the lock + SSE pub/sub
bridge for cross-pod event fan-out). Without it, worker-fired
`problem.opened` events wouldn't reach the api pods' SSE
streams; v0.6.3 wires that bridge so browsers connected to any
api pod see every event regardless of where it fired.

Same binary contract from v0.5.x: one image, one release
pipeline, one tag. Container runtime picks its role from a
single env var; the chart wires it from `deployment.mode`.

### Model Context Protocol (MCP) — external LLM access (v0.6.4+)

Coremetry exposes its telemetry as an [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io)
server so Claude Desktop, the Anthropic API tool-calling flow,
and internal copilots can investigate incidents via a uniform
JSON-RPC protocol instead of bespoke REST integrations.

Three capability surfaces are advertised:

- **Tools** (v0.6.5) — invokable functions: `list_services`,
  `get_service_health`, `list_problems`, `list_anomalies`,
  `search_logs`, `get_trace`, `query_metric`. Each has a JSON
  Schema for args and reads from the same MV path the UI uses.
- **Resources** (v0.6.6) — URI-addressed read-only references:
  `coremetry://services`, `coremetry://problems/open`, and
  templated URIs like `coremetry://trace/{trace_id}` or
  `coremetry://service/{name}`.
- **Prompts** (v0.6.7) — curated system+user message templates
  that surface the in-app ✨ Explain workflows over MCP:
  `explain_trace`, `explain_problem`, `suggest_runbook`,
  `explain_service_health`, `explain_exception`. The renderer
  fetches the data + combines with the canonical system prompt
  so the LLM gets a complete conversation seed.

Transport: HTTP+SSE per MCP spec 2024-11-05. GET
`/api/mcp/sse` opens the stream, POST `/api/mcp/messages?
sessionId=…` carries JSON-RPC requests. Auth via the existing
JWT/cookie middleware — viewer/editor/admin roles carry into
MCP just like REST.

Multi-pod note: MCP sessions are pod-local. In distributed
deployments, add session affinity at the ingress (sticky
cookie keyed on `Mcp-Session-Id` or the original sessionId
query param) so reconnects land on the same pod.

---

## OpenTelemetry agents

Coremetry consumes the same OTLP wire format every OTel SDK
emits. Sample setups:

- **Java**: `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://coremetry:4317
  OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL=grpc OTEL_SERVICE_NAME=my-service`
  with the OTel Java auto-instrumentation agent.
- **Go**: `otel-go` SDK with the standard
  `otlptracegrpc.WithEndpoint` exporter setup.
- **Python**: `opentelemetry-instrument` CLI plus
  `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` env.
- **Node.js / .NET**: equivalent `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_*`
  env-var setup.

Resource attributes Coremetry surfaces in the UI:
`service.name` (required), `service.version` (deploy
tracking), `telemetry.sdk.language`,
`process.runtime.{name,version,description}` (runtime badge),
`host.name` / `os.type` (saturation panel host attribution).

---

## Configuration

Highest-impact knobs in `config.yaml` (all overridable via
`COREMETRY_*` env vars):

```yaml
listen:
  http: ":8088"
  grpc: ":4317"

clickhouse:
  addr: "ch1:9000,ch2:9000"     # comma-separated for cluster
  database: "coremetry"
  username: "default"
  cluster_name: ""              # set to enable Distributed CH
  secure: false                 # native TLS (port 9440)

retention:
  spans_days: 30
  logs_days: 30
  metrics_days: 7

ingestion:
  batch_size: 10000
  buffer_size: 500000
  flush_interval: 5s
  workers: 8

sampling:
  default: 1.0                  # head sampling ratio
  always_keep_errors: true
  always_keep_roots: true
  tail:
    enabled: false
    window_sec: 30
    slow_ms: 1000

auth:
  initial_admin: "admin@coremetry.local"
  initial_password: "admin"     # rotate after first login
  oidc:
    enabled: false              # or manage live from Settings > SSO (overrides this block)
  # LDAP / AD configured live from Settings UI.

logs:
  backend: "clickhouse"         # or "elasticsearch"
```

See `internal/config/config.go` for the full schema +
defaults.

## Architecture

- **Single Go binary** (~30 MB statically linked) embeds the
  Vite SPA via `go:embed`. One artifact to deploy.
- **OTLP/gRPC + OTLP/HTTP** on the same listener config; the
  binary terminates both and writes to ClickHouse via the
  async insert path.
- **Background workers**: alert evaluator (1 min), anomaly
  detector (2 min), anomaly recorder (1 min), correlator
  (5 min), monitor runner (5 s), errors-inbox refresher
  (1 min), tail sampler sweeper (1 s when enabled). All
  leader-gated via Redis lock so HA replicas don't double-run.
- **HTTP/REST API** at `/api/...` (typed; see
  [`internal/api/api.go`](internal/api/api.go) for routes).
- **SSE event bus** at `/api/events` for sub-second push of
  problem / anomaly state changes to the browser.
- **Sub-binary `--reset-schema` mode** for the Helm
  pre-install hook + `--migrate-from <addr>` for one-shot
  bulk copy from a legacy CH cluster.

Backend (Go 1.25+). The binary embeds `frontend/dist` (`//go:embed`), so a
fresh clone needs the UI built once before `go build` succeeds:

```bash
make build-ui                      # frontend → frontend/dist (once, or after UI changes)
go build ./... && ./coremetry --config config.yaml
```

Frontend (Node 22+):

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev          # Vite dev server with /api proxied to localhost:8088
npm run build        # production build (TypeScript check + Vite bundle)
npm run build:analyze # bundle treemap → dist/bundle-analysis.html
```

Tests (CI runs the frontend suite in UTC — do the same locally):

```bash
go test ./...
cd frontend && TZ=UTC npx vitest run && npm run lint
make audit                         # repo-specific static checks; 🔴 blocks a tag
```
