// MetricsQL translation — the pure half of the VictoriaMetrics read
// backend (v0.9.1150, Faz 1; rollup aggregations v0.9.1154, Faz 1.5).
// Everything here is a function of its arguments so the whole translation
// is table-testable without a live VM; the client wraps these and does I/O
// only.
//
// THE TARGET DIALECT IS MetricsQL, NOT STRICT PromQL (operator correction,
// 2026-08-17). MetricsQL is a PromQL superset, so every grammar statement
// below — label-name charset, no IN operator, fully anchored regex
// matchers — still holds unchanged. But where the two dialects DIFFER,
// VictoriaMetrics' behaviour is the one that decides, and Faz 1.5 leans on
// two of those differences on purpose:
//
//   - rate()/increase() take the last raw sample BEFORE the lookbehind
//     window into account (that is why `increase_pure` exists as the
//     opt-out). So they need no extrapolation and still produce a value
//     when only one sample falls inside the window. This is exactly the
//     shape the CH path computes — a reset-protected per-series delta over
//     REAL dt, with extrapolation deliberately skipped and VictoriaMetrics
//     named as the reason (metricrate.go:31) — so the two backends agree
//     by construction rather than by luck.
//   - the lookbehind window is OPTIONAL. Omitted, VM fills in `step` for
//     most rollups but max(step, scrape_interval) for rate() and
//     default_rollup(). We write it EXPLICITLY anyway (rule 3), which
//     means the widening is now OUR job — see promRollupWindow.
//
// The file keeps its promql.go name: the dialect note belongs in the code,
// and the history of the file is worth more than the rename.
//
// Three rules run through the whole file:
//
//  1. The METRIC NAME is never REPLACED — but since v0.9.1159 it is
//     ACCOMPANIED. OTLP names live in VM as `jvm.memory.used`, as
//     `jvm_memory_used`, or as `jvm_memory_used_bytes` depending on how the
//     operator's write path named them, and we cannot know which — so we
//     send every spelling the OTel→Prometheus convention could have
//     produced and let the DATA decide which one answers (names.go). That
//     forces the `{__name__=…}` selector form (a bare `jvm.memory.used{}`
//     is not valid MetricsQL), which happens to work for EVERY spelling.
//     LABEL names are a different story: the grammar has no way to
//     express a dotted label name at all, so those must be sanitized.
//
//  2. A filter we cannot express is an ERROR, never a silent drop. The
//     v0.9.566 incident is the reason: a dropped `jvm.memory.type="heap"`
//     filter did not produce an empty panel, it produced heap+non-heap
//     summed and LABELLED heap. A wrong-but-plausible number is worse
//     than a failure, because nobody questions it.
//
//  3. A rollup window is a deterministic function of the REQUEST — the
//     step and the caller's rate window, nothing else. Never VM's
//     scrape-interval auto-detection, never the wall clock. Two polls of
//     the same panel must render the same expression, or the cache key
//     upstream (internal/api, metric-query:v3) stops describing the query
//     it keys.

//
// v0.9.1154 (Faz 1.5) adds the three ROLLUP-shaped aggregations. Faz 1
// refused them for being a shape change rather than an operator swap. That
// was accurate and is no longer a reason: metricTemplates.ts seeds `last`
// on every gauge family it recognises (runtime levels, memory, thread
// counts, DB pool state), so an operator in VM mode earned a 400 by
// CLICKING A CATALOGUE ROW — the most ordinary thing there is to do on that
// page.
//
//   - last → max(last_over_time(sel[W])). The max() wrap is a group
//     COLLAPSE, not a change of aggregation; the argument is in buildPromQL.
//   - rate → sum(rate(sel[W])). SUM, not avg: the CH path computes the rate
//     PER SERIES and then re-aggregates into the caller's group-by with a
//     sum, naming `sum(rate(counter)) by(label)` as the semantics it
//     reproduces (metricrate.go:28). Same idiom, same number.
//   - increase → sum(increase(sel[W])), the same idiom over the window
//     TOTAL instead of the per-second rate.
//
// v0.9.1157 (Faz 2) adds p50/p95/p99. Faz 1/1.5 refused them, and the
// stated reason was right for the time: a percentile is not an operator
// swap, it needs the histogram BUCKET series. That is exactly what this
// release supplies —
//
//	histogram_quantile(φ, sum by (le) (rate({__name__="<name>_bucket"}[W])))
//
// — the canonical idiom, in both dialects.
//
// The old refusal also named a SECOND obstacle: choosing between a bucket
// quantile and a value-quantile needs the instrument type, which VM does not
// report. That one is answered by committing rather than by detecting. This
// translation is UNCONDITIONALLY the bucket form; when the metric turns out
// not to be a histogram, the `_bucket` selector matches nothing and the
// result is EMPTY, not wrong. An empty answer with a note that names the
// series we looked for (see QueryMetricNoted) is a diagnosis the operator
// can act on. Guessing a value-quantile from a heuristic would be the other
// kind of answer — plausible, unverifiable, and off by however much the
// distribution is skewed (the v0.9.566 class).
//
// The rollup is `rate`, matching every Grafana dashboard and the Prometheus
// docs. `increase` would give the same φ (histogram_quantile reads bucket
// RATIOS, so any positive rescaling of every bucket leaves the answer
// unchanged), so the choice is entirely about which expression an operator
// recognises in VM's query log. The heatmap path picks the other one, and
// for a reason that is NOT cosmetic — see buildHistogramPromQL.

// ── The unfiltered-bucket-scan guard (v0.9.1164) ────────────────────────────
//
// WHY A GUARD AND NOT A FASTER QUERY. The operator's production VM carries
// ~12M active series and grew +281% in a day. At that size a selector whose
// ONLY matcher is the metric name is not a slow query, it is an unbounded
// one: `{__name__=~"a|b|c|d|e|f"}` is a regex over the whole name index, and
// for the bucket family every matching attribute set fans out again by `le`.
// Nothing downstream can shrink that — the by-clause groups AFTER the scan,
// the step only changes how many times VM runs it, and Coremetry's own
// max_execution_time equivalent does not exist on this path (VM's server-side
// limits are the operator's to set, and we cannot read them).
//
// So the honest options were: send it and let a shared vmselect degrade for
// everyone, or refuse with an actionable message. The refusal is a 400 with
// the class, the fix and the off-switch written out, which is the shape the
// package already uses for every other "we could guess, so we say what we
// looked for instead" case (emptyBucketNote, emptyNameNote).
//
// WHICH CLASSES ARE IN — operator decision, 2026-08-18:
//
//	percentile p50/p95/p99  → ALWAYS guarded. The branch reads
//	                          `<name>_bucket` unconditionally, so the `le`
//	                          fan-out is there even when the operator picked
//	                          an explicitly-suffixed row.
//	histogram heatmap       → ALWAYS guarded. Same `_bucket` selector, and
//	                          it additionally materialises a time × le grid
//	                          in Go (maxHistogramLEBuckets is the backstop
//	                          for cardinality, not for scan cost).
//	avg with no rollup      → guarded ONLY when the name may carry histogram
//	                          parts, i.e. exactly when the `or` composition
//	                          adds the `_sum`/`_count` ratio arm. A plain
//	                          gauge avg is one selector over one family and
//	                          stays free — guarding it would break the most
//	                          ordinary chart on the install to protect
//	                          against a cost it does not have.
//
// AND WHICH ARE DELIBERATELY OUT: rate / increase. Their histogram arm reads
// `_count`, which is ONE series per attribute set — the same cardinality as
// the gauge arm beside it, no `le` multiplication. The asymmetry with avg is
// real and was decided rather than derived (avg is in by operator call; its
// arm is `_sum`/`_count` too), so it is pinned by a test that asserts an
// unfiltered rate on a histogram name still PASSES. A future reader who
// notices the inconsistency should find it recorded here, not fix it silently.
//
// The raw MetricsQL proxy (QueryPromQLRange) is out for a structural reason,
// not a cost one: nothing on that path parses the operator's query, and that
// is the feature (see its header). A guard there would need the parser the
// package refuses to run.

// unfilteredBucketMsg builds the refusal.
//
// It names three things because a refusal with any of them missing is a dead
// end: WHICH query class was refused (the operator has several panels open
// and cannot tell which one 400'd), WHAT to add (service or label filter),
// and WHERE the off-switch is (requirement: the message states the guard in

	// In VM an OTLP histogram has NO base series — only `_bucket`, `_sum` and
	// `_count`. So `rate(http.server.request.duration)` and
	// `avg(http.server.request.duration) by (http.route)` both resolved to
	// nothing, which is what the operator saw in prod: a working latency chart
	// beside a permanently blank throughput one, and an empty "Response time ·
	// avg (by route)" panel on the service page.
	//
	// The fix is MetricsQL `or`, not a wider alternation, and the difference is
	// the whole design:
	//
	//	`a or b` is a set UNION with LEFT PRECEDENCE PER GROUP. Where the left
	//	arm produces a series, that series wins; groups present only in the right
	//	arm are filled from the right. So a real base series (a plain counter, a
	//	gauge) always beats the guessed histogram arm, and the histogram arm only
	//	speaks where the base was silent.
	//
	// An alternation would instead SUM the two families, which is how the first
	// cut of this release would have double-counted a metric that has both `x`
	// and `x_count`. `or` makes that impossible: it is probe-free
	// self-selection with a deterministic tiebreak, so nothing has to know in
	// advance which family the operator's write path produced.

//     gets 300s rather than a floor of 0 that would silently delete the
//     widening. The unsafe direction is unreachable by omission.

//     an operator raising the floor to smooth their rate charts must not
//     silently quadruple every increase() number — the v0.6.36 unit-scale
//     class, which is why the setting cannot reach this rollup at all. The
//     heatmap path shares the same exemption for the same reason and does not
//     even take the option (buildHistogramPromQL).

// ── Histogram bucket layout (v0.9.1157, Faz 2) ──────────────────────────────
//
// THE TWO AXES OF "CUMULATIVE", AND WHY ONLY ONE OF THEM IS TEMPORALITY.
//
// chstore.HistogramSeries — the shape /api/metrics/histogram returns and the
// frontend heatmap consumes (histogramHeatmap.ts) — wants, per time bucket, a
// vector of PER-BUCKET observation counts: counts[i] = observations that fell
// in (bounds[i-1], bounds[i]], with counts[N] the +Inf overflow. A Prometheus
// `_bucket` series is cumulative in BOTH directions, and each needs a
// different fix:
//
//  1. OVER TIME, each `<name>_bucket{le=…}` series is a monotonically
//     increasing counter since process start. VM undoes this for us:
//     `increase(…[step])` is a reset-protected window delta. It happens
//     upstream, so nothing here does temporality arithmetic — which is also
//     why the OTLP delta-vs-cumulative question never reaches this file. VM's
//     write path already resolved it when it materialised the counters.
//  2. ACROSS le, `le="0.1"` counts everything ≤ 0.1 — an inclusive PREFIX SUM.
//     This is not temporality at all and no rollup function undoes it; it is
//     what makes histogram_quantile possible. So the differencing below is
//     unconditional: subtract each bucket's prefix sum from the previous
//     bound's. Skipping it would put ~the whole population in the top bucket
//     and paint the heatmap as one bright band at the tail — a picture that
//     looks like a latency crisis.
//
// Both pieces are pure and table-tested (histogram_test.go) because both are
// silent when wrong: axis 2 mis-differenced yields a plausible heatmap, and
// the percentiles computed off it (PercentileFromBuckets) stay finite.

// bucketLayout turns a set of `le` label values into the read model's bucket
// layout.
//
// Returns the finite upper bounds ASCENDING + DEDUPED (len N, becoming
// HistogramSeries.Bounds), and slot[i] = the index in the (N+1)-wide counts
// vector that input i contributes to. `+Inf` maps to slot N — the overflow
// position — and is never a bound, because it is not a number the y-axis can
// place.
//
// THREE input properties are handled rather than assumed, and each has a real
// source:
//
//   - ARBITRARY ORDER. VM returns series in whatever order vmselect merged
//     them; there is no ordering guarantee on a query_range result.
//   - DUPLICATES. Our own `sum by (le)` cannot produce two series with the
//     same le, but a caller pointing this at a recording rule or a federated
//     view can. Two inputs sharing an le share a slot, and their counts ADD —
//     the same semantics the sum would have had.
//   - MISSING / UNPARSEABLE le. This is an ERROR, not a skip. A dropped
//     bucket does not empty the chart, it shifts every percentile and moves
//     mass into a neighbouring band — wrong-but-plausible, the v0.9.566 class.
//     The message names the offending value because the common cause is
//     recognisable on sight: a series with no `le` at all is usually not a
//     histogram bucket (VictoriaMetrics' own native histograms label buckets
//     `vmrange`, not `le`).

//
// Two guards, both of which change the answer rather than merely tidying it:
//
//   - A NEGATIVE difference is clamped to zero. It means the prefix sums are
//     not monotonic, which happens when a bucket series churned mid-window
//     (a pod restart lands one member's increase on a different grid slot
//     than its neighbour's). A negative COUNT has no meaning, and uint64
//     would wrap it into ~1.8e19 — a single cell that saturates the entire
//     heatmap's colour scale and makes every real value read as zero.
//   - The running reference only ever moves UP (`if c > prev`). Given
//     cum = [10, 8, 20] the alternative — carrying 8 forward — yields
//     10 + 0 + 12 = 22 observations from a histogram whose own total says 20.
//     Keeping the monotonic reference yields 10 + 0 + 10 = 20: the dip is
//     absorbed where it happened instead of being redistributed into the
//     tail, and the totals still agree with cum[N], which is what the
//     percentile estimator normalises against.
//
// Rounding is at the boundary and nowhere else: `increase()` over an integer
// counter is integral in principle, but it arrives as a float64 that has been
// through JSON, so 49.999999999999996 must become 50 rather than 49.
