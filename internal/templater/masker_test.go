// only matches against non-word). Without the new
// `<letters>_<digits>` rule, every "usr_54347 initiated
// transfer to account acc_1523" turned into its own Drain
// template — thousands of single-instance shapes in
// production banking installs. Operator-reported with
// screenshot showing 50+ NEW templates for the same
// underlying log shape, one per (user, account) tuple.
