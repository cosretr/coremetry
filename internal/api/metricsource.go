// metricSource — the ONE seam every operator-facing metric read passes
// through (v0.9.1150, VictoriaMetrics read backend Faz 1).
//
// Before this file the five metric handlers called *chstore.Store
// directly. Adding a second backend by editing each call site would have
// produced the drift class that keeps costing us releases: one surface
// migrated, another not, and no compiler or test noticing (v0.9.566 —
// the dashboards "metric" branch had silently diverged from
// /api/metrics/query on filters for months).
//
// So the seam is an INTERFACE both backends satisfy with IDENTICAL method
// signatures, deliberately copied from *chstore.Store. Signature drift on
// either side is a compile error. A source-pin test
// (metricsource_test.go) additionally asserts api.go contains no direct
// s.store.<metric method> call, so a new handler cannot rejoin the old
// path by accident.
//
// WHAT IS IN SCOPE is as important as what the seam does. Faz 1 routes
// the metric DISCOVERY + QUERY surfaces an operator drives by hand:
// catalogue/picker, Explore, dashboard metric panels, MCP query_metric,
// label values, attribute keys. Everything else stays on ClickHouse ON
// PURPOSE:
//
//   - span-derived reads (services, operations, topology, traces, …) are
//     not metrics at all;
//   - fixed-name internal readers (hosts, infra, JVM panels, db capacity, the
//     DQL evaluator in dql.go) each hard-code metric names and CH-side column
//     behaviour. Routing them piecemeal would put two backends behind one
//     page.
//
// v0.9.1268 REMOVED ONE NAME FROM THAT SECOND LIST, and the removal is the
// more instructive half of the rule. service_metric_throughput.go — the
// service-Overview throughput mapper — was listed as deliberately ClickHouse.
// That reasoning was sound in v0.9.1150 and went stale the moment VM became a
// PRIMARY backend rather than an alternative view: on a VM install the panel
// searched a store the metric does not live in, and reported the honest empty
// that operator-reported bug arrived as. "Deliberately scoped to CH" and
// "pinned to the wrong store" are the same code; only the deployment around it
// decides which one it is.
//
// So the second list means "reads that a backend could not answer
// differently", not "reads we have not gotten to". dql.go still qualifies —
// its evaluator IS ClickHouse query machinery. A fixed metric NAME never
// qualified on its own.
//
// v0.9.1157 (Faz 2) brought the last two operator-driven metric surfaces
// through the seam: GET /api/metrics/histogram and GET /api/metrics/promql.
// They joined LATE and separately because neither is a signature copy of a
// chstore method the way the Faz 1 four are:
//
//   - the histogram IS chstore-shaped (QueryMetricHistogram), so it is a
//     plain seam method and the compile-time identity argument applies
//     unchanged;
//   - the PromQL proxy is NOT. Its ClickHouse half is internal/promql's
//     evaluator over the store, not a store method, so the seam declares
//     its own signature and each adapter owns its dialect. That is also
//     where the deliberate asymmetry lives: CH pre-parses (ValidatePromQL),
//     VM does not, because MetricsQL is a superset our parser would reject.
//
// There is NO fallback from VM to CH. If the operator turned VM on and VM
// is down, the endpoint fails with VM's error (502 at the handler). A
// fallback would answer with numbers from a store the operator did not
// select, and unlike the Tempo trace fallback — where a banner is enough
// because the trace is either there or not — the NUMBERS would differ and
// nothing on screen could say so.

// ── Per-request source override (v0.9.1151, deneme modu) ────────────────────
//
// `?metricsrc=vm|ch` picks the backend for ONE request. The operator asked
// for it because metric NAMES differ between the two stores (VM sanitises
// `jvm.memory.used` to `jvm_memory_used`), so "does VM actually answer my
// dashboards" cannot be settled by reading Settings — it needs one real
// chart. The global toggle is the wrong instrument for that question: it
// moves every panel, picker and dashboard of every logged-in user at once,
// and moves them back just as loudly.
//
// Precedent: the old-engine escape hatch that carried the chart-engine
// migration (retired v0.9.844 — a frontend gate now bans that flag's NAME
// from the tree, so it is described here rather than named). Same posture,
// deliberately — a URL param, no UI that writes it, no persistence. An
// operator types it; nothing in the product hands it out. That is what
// keeps it a probe rather than a second, invisible configuration surface
// that some page could get stuck in.
//
// Two asymmetries worth naming, because both were choices:
//
//   - `metricsrc=vm` does NOT require Enabled. Requiring it would make
//     the param useless — trying VM before committing to it is the entire
//     point. It DOES require a base URL, because without one there is
//     nothing to call.
//   - `metricsrc=ch` is always valid, even with VM as the default. The
//     escape hatch has to work in both directions or an operator who
//     turned VM on and hit a gap has no way to check the same chart
//     against ClickHouse.
//
// There is still NO silent fallback. `metricsrc=vm` against an
// unconfigured VM is a 400 that names the Settings page, never a quiet
// ClickHouse read — the reason is the same one metricsource.go's header
// gives for refusing VM→CH fallback: the numbers would differ and nothing
// on screen could say so.
